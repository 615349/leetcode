Days of the week are represented as three-letter strings ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun").

Write a function that, given a string S representing the day of the week and an integer K (between 0 and 500, inclusive), returns the day of the week that is K days later.

For example, S = 'Wed', and K = 2, function should return "Fri"

Given S = 'Sat', and K = 23, the function should return "Mon"
